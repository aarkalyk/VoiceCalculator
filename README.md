## VoiceCalculator  
VoiceCalculator is an iOS app that evaluates simple mathematical expressions provided by voice.

The app was written in Swift 3.0.

One 3rd party framework was used - Neon for UI layout.

Expression evaluation was implemented using Reverse Polish Notation.

#### Supported operations: 
- ✖️ multiplication 
- ➗ division 
- ➖ subtraction 
- ➕ addition 

The UI was inspired by the flag of Poland 🇵🇱 as a tribute to the origin of Notation 😉
